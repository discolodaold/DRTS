* needs to support a tree of object class - single inhertance
* classes have a ordered list of behaviours, behaviours are in charge of network read and write, creation and event handling

behaviour Position {
	data {
		float x
		float y
	}
}

actor Debris [Position] {
	model {
		sprite {
			image "images/debris01.tga"
		}
	}

	think {
		wait 10 {
			die
		}
	}
}

behaviour Health {
	data {
		int health;
	}

	onDamage(int damage) {
		health = health - damage;
		if(health < 0)
			onDeath();
